# [Use the index, Luke!](https://use-the-index-luke.com/)

## [Preface](https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/preface)

SQL is perhaps the most successful fourth-generation programming language. Its main benefit is the capability to separate *what* and  *how*. An SQL statement is a straight description of *what* is needed without instructions as to *how* to get it done.

The aforementioned abstraction reaches its limits when it comes to performance: the author of an SQL statement by definition does _not_ care about *how* the database executes the statement. Consequently, the author is not responsible for slow execution. However, experience proves the opposite; i.e., the author _must_ know a little bit about the database to prevent performance problems.

It turns out that the *only* thing developers need to learn is how to index. The most important information for indexing is how the applications queries the data.

This book book covers the most important index type only: *B-tree index*.

## [Anatomy of an index](https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/anatomy)

An index is pure redundancy. Creating an index does not change the table data; it just creates a new data structure that refers to the table.

Once indexed, all elements are arranged in a well-defined order, thus making finding data fast and easy since the sort order determines each entry's position.

Given the constant changes that a DB goes through, an index must be able to keep on sync in a timely fashion, without moving large amounts of data. In order to accomplish those goals, the database combines two distinct data structures: a `doubly linked list` and a `search tree`. This two data structures explain most of the database's performance characteristics.

### [The index leaf nodes](https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/anatomy/the-leaf-nodes)

The primary purpose of an index is to provide an ordered representation of the indexed data. It is, however, not possible to store the data sequentially because an `INSERT` statement would need to move the following entries to fit the new one. The solution is to establish a logical order that is independent of the physical order in memory. Enter the [[notes/fa4fc8e8]].

Databases use doubly linked lists to connect the so-called index _leaf nodes_. Each leaf node is stored in a database _block_ or _page_; the database's smallest storage unit. All index blocks are the same size, typically a few kilobytes. Each block stores as many index entries as possible. The order is thus maintained in two different levels: the index entries within each leaf node, and the leaf nodes among each other using the doubly linked list.

### [The Search Tree (B-Tree) Makes the Index Fast](https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/anatomy/the-tree)

A database needs a second data structure to find an entry among the shuffled _blocks_ quickly: a [[notes/31b03986]]

Once created, the database maintains the index automatically. It applies every `INSERT`, `DELETE` and `UPDATE` to the index and keeps the tree in balance, thus causing maintenance overhead for write operations.

### [Slow Indexes, Part I](https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/anatomy/slow-indexes)

The first ingredient for a slow index lookup is the leaf node chain. An index lookup not only needs to perform the tree traversal, but it also needs to follow the leaf node chain if more than one match is to be expected.

The second ingredient for a slow index lookup is accessing the table. Even a single leaf node might contain many hits, often hundreds. The corresponding table data is usually scattered across many blocks, meaning that there is additional tables access for each hit.

An index lookup, thus, requires three steps:

1. The tree traversal
2. Following the leaf chain
3. Fetching the table data

Only the first steps has an upper-bound, the tree depth. The remaining two might need to access many blocks, causing a slow index lookup. The belief that an index lookup just traverses the tree is what encourages the `degenerated index` myth.

#### INDEX UNIQUE SCAN

It performs the tree traversal only, if a unique constraint ensures that the search criteria will match no more than one entry.

#### INDEX RANGE SCAN

It performs the tree traversal and follows the leaf node chain to find all matching entries. This is the fallÂ­back operation if multiple entries could possibly match the search criteria. It can potentially read a large part of an index. If there is one more table access for each row, the query can become slow even when using an index.

#### TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID

It retrieves the row from the table. This operation is (often) performed for every matched record from a preceding index scan operation.
