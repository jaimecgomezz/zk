# Logarithmic scalability

In mathematics, the [[notes/c7c39f7c]] of a number to a given base is the power or exponent to which the base must be raised in order to produce the number.

In a search tree, the base corresponds to the number of entries per branch node and the exponent to the tree depth. Each time the depth increases, the number of entries multiplies by the number of entries per node. The logarithm reverses this function.

Depth = log<sub>`number-of-entries-per-node`</sub>(`number-of-index-entries`)

The main factor that affects the tree depth, and therefore the lookup performance, is the number of entries in each tree node. The higher the basis, the shallower the tree, the faster the traversal.

| Tree depth   | Index entries    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| 3   | 64   |
| 4   | 256   |
| 5   | 1,024   |
| 6   | 4,096   |
| 7   | 16,384   |
| 8   | 65,536   |
| 9   | 262,144   |
| 10   | 1,048,576   |
