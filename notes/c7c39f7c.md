# Logarithms

Logarithms are another way of thinking about exponents.

We know that `2` raised to the power of `4` equals `16`, expressed by the exponential equation:

2<sup>4</sup> = 16

If we needed to determine `2` raised to `which power` equals `16`, we'd used the following logarithmic equation:

log<sub>2</sub>(16) = 4

Both equation describe the same relationship between the numbers `2`, `4` and `16`, where `2` is the `base` and `4` is the `exponent`.

b<sup>c</sup> = a <=> log<sub>b</sub>(a) = c

NOTE: The base of the of exponent is the same as the base of the logarithm.
